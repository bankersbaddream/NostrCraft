- üöÄ **Server Start/Stop** - Know when your server comes online or goes offline
- üëã **Player Join/Leave** - Track when players connect and disconnect

3. Start your server to generate the default configuration
4. Stop your server and configure your Nostr keys (see Configuration section)
5. Restart your server

## Configuration

Edit `plugins/NostrCraft/config.yml`:

```yaml
# NostrCraft Configuration

public-key: "your-64-character-hex-public-key" 
relay: "wss://relay.damus.io"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Plugin fails to load:**
- Ensure you're running Paper 1.21.5+ or compatible
- Check that Java 21+ is installed
- Verify the JAR file is in the correct `plugins/` directory

**Can't connect to relay:**
- Check that the relay URL is correct and accessible
- Verify your internet connection allows WebSocket connections
- Try a different relay if the current one is down

**Events not appearing on Nostr:**
- Verify your private and public keys are correct 64-character hex strings
- Ensure the keys match (public key should be derived from private key)
- Check server logs for error messages

### Viewing Logs

Check your server console or `logs/latest.log` for NostrCraft messages:
- `INFO` messages show successful connections and events
- `SEVERE` messages indicate errors that need attention
- `FINE` messages show detailed debugging information
